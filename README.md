# Notes  

## String Operations  
1. Convert an integer to a string using `Integer.toString(x)`.  
2. To check if a string starts or ends with another string, use `startsWith` or `endsWith`.  

## Array Operations  
1. Arrays are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified.  
2. Use a `for` loop to add (push) or remove (pull) elements as needed.
